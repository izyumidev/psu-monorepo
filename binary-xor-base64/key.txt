Beginning in 1997 with a visionary challenge from Penn State President Graham Spanier, the creation of what is now known as the College of Information Sciences and Technology (IST) all started from a fifteen-member group, lead by then-dean of the Graduate School, Rod Erickson. The then-plan was to have IST as a school, with its curriculum focused on topics dealing with the Information Age.

In August 1999, the doors opened for the first IST students at Penn State locations statewide. Over a few years, the school developed rapidly through the formation of research collaborations, creation of online courses, expansion of faculty members, establishment of graduate programs and the planning of the IST building.

In May 2003 baccalaureate degrees were conferred on Penn State's first full graduating IST class. Later that year, the IST building was completed and was formally opened in 2004, making it one of Penn State's landmarks.

The school of IST was renamed the College of IST by the Penn State Board of Trustees in January 2006 - a designation that signified IST's importance within both the Penn State system and the Commonwealth.
